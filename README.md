# gpod - Growth Picture of the Day

A project "inspired" on [growlab](https://github.com/alexellis/growlab) by [@alexellis](https://github.com/alexellis/) and  [NASA apod](https://apod.nasa.gov/) :laughing: :laughing:

gpod is a camera module to monitor the growth of seeds and vegetable gardens in general.

With the objective is to closely monitor the development of the plants and collect environment data and share their evolutions.

Using the Azure Cognitive Services to describe the pictures taken to make things more interesting...

And then create some really cool time lapses :smile:
